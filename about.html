      <p id="about-1">
        I'm originally from Mānoa valley, located in the heart of Honolulu, and I'm a Full-Stack JavaScript Web Developer. My journey into programming began during my junior year at Kamehameha High School, when I got my first job building websites for a company called As I Would Create. I fell in love with the work, and spent many hours learning more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript through online classes and YouTube videos. Because of my increased skill set, I was able to secure more advanced work with As I Would Create. In January of 2017, I was ready to level up, and I was accepted to Hawaiʻi's first web development bootcamp, DevLeague.

      <p id="about-2">
        After 12 intensive weeks of full-stack JavaScript, I was certain about two things. I knew for certain that this was the career path for me. Never had I been so passionate about something. It still feels wrong to call it "work". I also realized is that I had to leave the islands to truly follow my dream. That realization brought me to Los Angeles. I'm motivated to excel in this industry, collaborative, and always ready and able to pick up new skills as the needs of a project evolve. I'm incredibly excited to take my career to a new level as a web developer in a technological and cultural hub like LA, and look forward to exceeding your expectations. A hui hou!
